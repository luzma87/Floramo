    <string name="about">
        We present 100 native plant species found in the páramo of Cajas, Azuay province, Ecuador.
        Páramo is a unique ecosystem dominated by bunch-grasses above the tree-line in the Andes mountains.
        The plants are not necessarily the most common species, but they are showy, easy to find, and relatively easy to identify.
        We believe that by recognizing and naming wild plants the user will gain an increased appreciation of the flora of Ecuador
        and will strive to protect them and the páramo environment.
